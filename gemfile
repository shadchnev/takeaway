# Chris, well done for using the Gemfile
# However, you need to follow the syntax very carefully
# 1. The Gemfile always starts with a capital G, this is important
# 2. The format is exactly as follows, this is important:
source "https://www.rubygems.org/"
gem "twilio-ruby", "3.11.4"
# 3. If you had everything correctly, then you'd have Gemfile.lock after running 'bundle install'
